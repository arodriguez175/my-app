# Time Tracking Dashboard App

## Description

This is a dash board app that shows the user the amount of hours and previous hours that was tracked for a task for either the day, the week, or the month. There are six different tasks that show the tracked hours and are shown in sections of the dashboard in the form of boxes labeled Work, Play, Study, Exercise, Social, and Selfcare. There is also a section where there is an image of the person who are doing these tasks along with their name.

## What this Application Does

This app displays the amount of hours and previous hours that were saved and displays it to the user in different sections of the app after clicking on one of the options of daily, weekly, or monthly.

## Technologies Used
