# Time Tracking Dashboard App

## Description

This is a dash board app that shows the user the amount of hours and previous hours that was tracked for a task for either the day, the week, or the month. There are six different tasks that show the tracked hours and are shown in sections of the dashboard in the form of boxes labeled Work, Play, Study, Exercise, Social, and Selfcare. There is also a section where there is an image of the person who are doing these tasks along with their name.

## What this Application Does

This app displays the amount of pre given hours and previous hours that was saved and displays it to the user in different sections of the app after clicking on one of the options of daily, weekly, or monthly.

## Technologies Used

The project was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and using the React.js library with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to Run It

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Or

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Features I Hope to Implement in the Future

- The ability to actually track time for the user instead of showing the time that is already saved in the app
- Track minutes and seconds
- More breakpoints other than desktop view and mobile view
- Adding a break point between desktop screen size and mobile screen size
- The ability for the user to be able to upload their photo to replace the default one
- The ability for the user to add their name to the dashboard to replace the default one
